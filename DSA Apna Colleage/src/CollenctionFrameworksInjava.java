//1. Collection frameworks are a set of tools that comes to handy when we us DSA functions...
//2. Collection frameworks are a set of Classes and interfaces that helps us to solve our coding problems...
//3. There are 3 types of Interfaces Under Colllection interface(Which is under Iterable interface)....
//		LIST QUEUES SET...these are basically interfaces and also the DATA Strutures...

//4. Methods used on above Data Structure to perform some of the operations....
		//add,size,remove,iterate,addAll,removeAll,clear.....

//5. Comes 1st the LIST INTERFACE(easiest to implement)	->	 Has 3 important classes: ArrayList,LinkedList,Stack..
//		ArrayList - Like of an Array but has a variable Size.....
//		LinkedList - Alag alag objects ko agar compile kar le toh hume ek linkedlist miljaata hey...
//		stack - ek ke baad ek plates ki tarah agar humari memory ko allocate karna chahe usko Stact Data Structure Bola jaata hey...


//6. Queues ko nahi kiyaa hey..


//7. Set Interfaces(/DATA STRUCTURES) are the most important and asked in interviews...(espectialy the Hashset) 
//		This has the following classes: 	HASHSET,LINKEDHASHSET,TREESET....
//		Set	-> A collection of UNIQUELY DEFINED OBJECTS....
//		Hashset - a set having uniquely defined objects jo ki jahan kahan pe bhi pada huaa hey....
//		Linkedhashset - hashsets jo ki linked hey in a sequential manner...
//		Treeset - Agar set ki elemnts ko kisi bhi tareeke se sort kia jaa sakta hey ascending or decending order..
//		


//8. Map interface which combines the lock data along with the key data..(Basically through sets hum elements ko map karte hey)
//		Have same classes as of the Set interfaces.....HASHMAP,LINKEDHASHMAP,TREEMAP,HASHTABLE.....



//9. We rread about Linkedlist,Heaps,Stacks,Quese but Trees and Graphs are the self designed interfaces which are implemented using the above interfaces...
